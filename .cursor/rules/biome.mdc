* Prefer **ReadLints** for quick feedback when editing files; only run biome in terminal for a full check/format.
* When running biome in terminal: use `biome ...` (never `npx biome ...` or `cd ... && biome` — see cli.mdc).
* Only run biome after bigger changes (multiple files). Skip for tiny fixes (typos, single-line).
* When applying: run `biome check --write .` then `biome ci`; fix issues and repeat until `biome ci` passes.
