# NEVER do this (we are already in project root)
* ❌ `cd C:\git\popschool\mcp && ...` or any `cd` to the workspace path
* ❌ `npx biome check .` or any `npx biome ...` — use `biome ...` without npx

# Always do this instead
* Run commands from current directory: `biome check .` or `bun run ...`
* Use `biome` (or `bunx biome`) — never `npx biome`

# Windows / PowerShell
* Use PowerShell-compatible syntax: `cmd1; cmd2` not `cmd1 && cmd2` when chaining
* Or run commands separately
